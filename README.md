# Dice
A simple 6-sided die to use for games. I built this for my girls (hence the multi-colors!) so they could play their Frozen pop-up game easier. 

## How To Role the Die
First, go to http://joeday.github.io/dice on any browser. Then...

#### On Mobile
Touch the die. It works, but I will improve the touch responsiveness at some point. 

#### On Desktop
You have two options to roll the die:

1.  Press Spacebar
2.  Click the die
